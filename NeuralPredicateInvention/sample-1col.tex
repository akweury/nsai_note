The goal of our work is to find a predicate invention pipeline so that some high level concepts are not necessarily given from reasoning language directly. But they can be invented as needed during training. The invention is important since it is a way to acquire new knowledge and shows the ability of intelligence. On the other hand, it improves the generalization of AI models for adapting unseen tasks. The invention model improves the system to describe the problem more accurate.

%TODO: rewrite...
However, the invention is still based on given background knowledge. It has to be simple, combinable,  and mutually compatible, so that the new concepts are various and accurate.

In order to using a single language to cover two objects spatial relations as many as possible, we designed an area division map called \textit{target map}. As shown in figure \ref{fig:8-area}, the surrounding area according to the reference object has been divided into 8 sub-areas. 
The areas in the target map are considered as background knowledge. The concepts like left, right, nearby supposed to be invented as new predicates during the training if any of them are needed to represent the target pattern in the positive images.  This map both considers the distance and directions of the latent relation objects. 
Using the target map, multiple real-world related spatial concepts can be represented by combining some of atom areas, such as 
\textit{left} (combining area 2,3,6,7), 
\textit{right}(combining area 0,1,4,5), 
\textit{nearby}(combining area 0,1,2,3) and so on.

\section{Predicate Invention}
The target of inductive logic programming is to find a target clause $ P $ for the positive patterns $ Q $ , such that the clause $ P $ describes some logical relations that exist and only exist in the positive patterns. 
Thus the target clause $ P $ is sufficient and necessary for the positive patterns $ Q $.
\[ P\Leftrightarrow Q \]

\subsection{Clause generation loop.}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.618\textwidth]{img/clause_invention_chart.png}
	\caption{Clause Invention Chart.}
	\label{fig:clause-invention-chart}
\end{figure}

Base on the scoring areas of the predicates, we can classify them into several groups, where $ N $ is the number of PN pairs.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Sufficient and Necessary Clause}: scores on $ (0,1) $ only, i.e. $ s_{01} =N$ They are sufficient and necessary for the target pattern.
	\item \textbf{Necessary Clause}: scores on $ (0,1) $ and $ (1,1) $, i.e. $ s_{01} + s_{11} = N $. They are necessary for the target pattern. They always true in the positive images, but also can be true in negative images.
	\item \textbf{Sufficient Clause}: scores on $ (0,0) $ and $ (0,1) $, i.e. $ s_{00}+s_{01} = N $. They represents the concepts that might appear in the positive image, but never in a negative image.
	\item \textbf{Useless Clause}: Sometimes the clauses getting from cluster or extending can be useless.
\end{itemize}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:clause-invention-chart}, we apply cluster and extend operations on the clauses to get a sufficient and necessary clause.

\textbf{Sufficient Condition}: In order to find a sufficient clause, we can \textbf{extend} the beam search clauses with adding more predicates in the body, until it is sufficient.

\textbf{Necessary Condition}: In order to invent a necessary predicate, we can \textbf{cluster} independent beam search clauses. Independent means the clauses do not share same predicates. This kind of predicates invent high level concepts. For example, cluster low level concept \textit{south}, \textit{east}, \textit{north}, \textit{west}, which are independent with each other, we can have a high level concept \textit{directions}.



This invention approach may take several rounds. After each round, we check if any sufficient and necessary clauses have been generated, if there exist such, it is the target clause we want to find. If no such clauses, we take another round for clause searching.

\subsection{Solving Kandinsky Patterns with PI}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\caption{Kandinsky Patterns. (a) blah (b) blah (c) blah (d) blah}
	\label{fig:kandinsky-patterns}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Nearby}
To solve the nearby pattern, we invent the concept $ inv\_pred\_1O\_1, O\_2 $ by cluster clauses, which actually represent the concept \textit{nearby}. It is necessary for the target patterns since it is true in all the positive images. It is also directly a sufficient predicate since no negative image has this pattern. The target clauses can be described as follows:
\begin{align*}
	target(X) :- & in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X), inv\_pred\_1(O_1,O_2).\\
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1, O_2) :- 	& in(O_1,X), in(O_2,X), a\_0(O_1,O_2).\\
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1, O_2) :- 	& in(O_1,X), in(O_2,X), a\_1(O_1,O_2).\\									
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Red Triangle}
To solve the red triangle pattern, we require the concept \textit{nearby} first by cluster clauses. It is necessary for the target patterns but not yet sufficient. Then we use beam search to extend this necessary clause with adding predicates, a sufficient and necessary clause is generated in several steps.
\begin{align*}
	target(X) :- & in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X), inv\_pred\_1(O_1,O_2), \\
						& shape(O_1, triangle), color(O_1, red), \\
						& diff\_shape\_pair(O_1,_O2), diff\_color\_pair(O_1,O_2)\\
	\\
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1, O_2) :- 	& in(O_1,X), in(O_2,X), a\_0(O_1,O_2).\\
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1, O_2) :- 	& in(O_1,X), in(O_2,X), a\_1(O_1,O_2).\\		
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1, O_2) :- 	& in(O_1,X), in(O_2,X), a\_2(O_1,O_2).\\																
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1, O_2) :- 	& in(O_1,X), in(O_2,X), a\_3(O_1,O_2).\\									
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Online-Pair}
For online-pair patterns, five objects are align on a line, whereas two of them have the same color and same pair. 
In this pattern, no necessary clauses can be found  by clustering predicates. Thus we have to extend the clauses using beam search, until it is sufficient. Then for the sufficient clauses that we have found, we perform clustering for necessity.

A possible target clauses searching by predicate invention system is shown as follows
\begin{align*}
	target(X) :- & in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
						& inv\_pred\_1(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5)\\
			 			\\
		inv\_pred\_1(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) :- 	& in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
																				& a\_0(O_4,O_1),a\_2(O_2,O_1), same\_shape\_pair(O_2,O_4)\\
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) :- 	& in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
																			& a\_2(O_2,O_5),a\_2(O_5,O_3),color(O_3, blue)\\
	inv\_pred\_1(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) :- 	& in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
																			& a\_3(O_2,O_1),a\_3(O_4,O_2),a\_3(O_5,O_4)\\
																			\\
	inv\_pred\_2(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) :- 	& in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
																			& a\_0(O_4,O_1),a\_2(O_2,O_1),same\_shape\_pair(O_2,O_4)\\
	inv\_pred\_2(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) :- 	& in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
																			& a\_1(O_3,O_1),a\_3(O_2,O_4),same\_color\_pair(O_2,O_4)\\																			
	inv\_pred\_2(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) :- 	& in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
																			& a\_2(O_2,O_5),a\_2(O_5,O_3),color(O\_3, blue)\\
	inv\_pred\_2(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) :- 	& in(O_1,X),in(O_2,X),in(O_3,X),in(O_4,X),in(O_5,X) \\
																			& a\_3(O_2,O_1),a\_3(O_4,O_2),a\_3(O_5,O_4)\\																			
\end{align*}

Note that the predicate $ inv\_pred\_1(O_1,O_2,O_3,O_4,O_5) $ share the same bodies $ same\_shape\_pair(O_1,O_2), same\_color\_pair(O_1,O_2) $, which corresponds the concept $ five\_object\_on\_the\_same\_line\_with\_one\_pair\_of\_same\_color\_and\_shape\_objects $. We can remove shared bodies in the clause definition. Then the predicate corresponds a simpler concept $ five\_object\_on\_the\_same\_line $, which is a necessary predicate. It becomes sufficient after adding the deleted predicate back to. Removing shared bodies is not necessary but it can simplify the corresponding concepts of invented predicates. 
 
\subsection{Evaluation by Sufficiency}
The invented predicates can be sufficient for positive patterns, which equivalent to the target predicate as well. Once we have found a sufficient predicate for the positive patterns, we are done. Thus it is desirable for the task. 
However, for searching complicate target patterns, the sufficient predicates usually cannot be invented in one step. Instead, they need other invented predicates as prerequisites. In this case, these prerequisite predicates are necessary for sufficient predicates. Thus they are supposed to be invented beforehand and used for sufficient predicate invention.

\subsection{Evaluation by Necessity} 
% Invented predicates, on the contrary to the target predicate, should be \textit{necessary} for positive patterns. 
 Necessary evaluation keeps predicates those are true in all positive patterns. They can be insufficient, thus they can also be true in negative patterns. Necessary predicates are invented as prerequisite for sufficient predicate invention.
The necessity guarantees the searching for invented predicates is controlled in a proper scale, since only limited necessary conditions exist in the positive patterns. 
If we loose the necessity assumption, the searching domain for invented predicates can be huge since the conditions that doesn't exist in the positive patterns are irregular and  countless. 
However, searching for some that necessary for the majority of positive patterns is reasonable. In this paper, we apply the necessity condition only for all the positive patterns.% TODO: check this limition.



\subsection{Invented Clause Evaluation}


Invented predicates are trivial if they are necessary for both positive and negative patterns. 

A partial strict positive predicate 
During evaluation, only predicates which evaluate all the PN pairs as general positive and the number of strict positive PN pairs is more than half are kept. The 
They don't reduce the searching domain for the target predicate invention.  
Instead of evaluate on images  one by one. 
We can take a pair of positive and negative image

Think about "How" to cluster the existing clauses. Simply cluster all the clauses as one single concept cannot handle complicate rules.

If NSFR gives following clauses, then which of those clauses should be clustered as the new concept?

If there is a pattern with multiple rules,
a iteration-based approach should be proposed.
First several iteration, it should be able to learn some new predicates, then use new predicates to describe the new scenarios.

New predicate has to be able to 100\% describe the positive images. Otherwise, reconsider it.

\begin{align*}
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea0(X,Y), atArea2(Y,X)  \\
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea1(X,Y),atArea3(Y,X) \\
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea1(X,Y) \\    
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea2(X,Y) \\    
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea4(X,Y),atArea6(Y,X) \\
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea5(X,Y),atArea7(Y,X) \\
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea5(X,Y) \\    
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow atArea6(X,Y) \\
	target(X,Y) &\leftarrow pred1(X,Y) \\
\end{align*}

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

\section{Template parameters}

There are a number of template
parameters which modify some part of the \verb|ceurart| document class.
This parameters are enclosed in square
brackets and are a part of the \verb|\documentclass| command:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass[parameter]{ceurart}
\end{lstlisting}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|twocolumn| : Two column layout.
\item \verb|hf| : Enable header and footer\footnote{You can enable
    the display of page numbers in the final version of the entire
    collection. In this case, you should adhere to the end-to-end
    pagination of individual papers.}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Front matter}

\subsection{Title Information}

The titles of papers should be either all use the emphasizing
capitalized style or they should all use the regular English (or
native language) style. It does not make a good impression if you or
your authors mix the styles.

Use the \verb|\title| command to define the title of your work. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.

\subsection{Title variants}

\verb|\title| command have the below options:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|title|: Document title. This is default option. 
\begin{lstlisting}
\title[mode=title]{This is a title}
\end{lstlisting}
You can just omit it, like as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
\title{This is a title}
\end{lstlisting}

\item \verb|alt|: Alternate title.
\begin{lstlisting}
\title[mode=alt]{This is a alternate title}
\end{lstlisting}

\item \verb|sub|: Sub title.
\begin{lstlisting}
\title[mode=sub]{This is a sub title}
\end{lstlisting}
You can just use \verb|\subtitle| command, as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
\subtitle{This is a sub title}
\end{lstlisting}

\item \verb|trans|: Translated title.
\begin{lstlisting}
\title[mode=trans]{This is a translated title}
\end{lstlisting}

\item \verb|transsub|: Translated sub title.
\begin{lstlisting}
\title[mode=transsub]{This is a translated sub title}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

\verb|\author| command have the below options: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|style| : Style of author name (chinese)
\item \verb|prefix| : Prefix
\item \verb|suffix| : Suffix
\item \verb|degree| : Degree
\item \verb|role| : Role
\item \verb|orcid| : ORCID
\item \verb|email| : E-mail
\item \verb|url| : URL
\end{itemize}

Author names can have some kinds of marks and notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item affiliation mark: \verb|\author[<num>]|.
\end{itemize}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use an explicit mark to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}

Author block example:
\begin{lstlisting}
\author[1,2]{Author Name}[%
    prefix=Prof.,
    degree=D.Sc.,
    role=Researcher,
    orcid=0000-0000-000-0000,
    email=name@example.com,
    url=https://name.example.com
]

\address[1]{Affiliation #1}
\address[2]{Affiliation #2}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Abstract shall be entered in an environment that starts
with \verb|\begin{abstract}| and ends with
\verb|\end{abstract}|. 

\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{abstract}
  This is an abstract.
\end{abstract}
\end{lstlisting}

The key words are enclosed in a \verb|keywords|
environment. Use \verb|\sep| to separate keywords.

\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{keywords}
  First keyword \sep 
  Second keyword \sep 
  Third keyword \sep 
  Fourth keyword
\end{keywords}
\end{lstlisting}

At the end of front matter add \verb|\maketitle| command.

\subsection{Various Marks in the Front Matter}

The front matter becomes complicated due to various kinds
of notes and marks to the title and author names. Marks in
the title will be denoted by a star ($\star$) mark;
footnotes are denoted by super scripted Arabic numerals,
corresponding author by an Conformal asterisk (*) mark.

\subsubsection{Title marks}

Title mark can be entered by the command, \verb|\tnotemark[<num>]|
and the corresponding text can be entered with the command
\verb|\tnotetext[<num>]{<text>}|. An example will be:

\begin{lstlisting}
\title{A better way to format your document for CEUR-WS}

\tnotemark[1]
\tnotetext[1]{You can use this document as the template for preparing your
  publication. We recommend using the latest version of the ceurart style.}
\end{lstlisting}

\verb|\tnotemark| and \verb|\tnotetext| can be anywhere in
the front matter, but should be before \verb|\maketitle| command.

\subsubsection{Author marks}

Author names can have some kinds of marks and notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item footnote mark : \verb|\fnmark[<num>]|
\item footnote text : \verb|\fntext[<num>]{<text>}|
\item corresponding author mark : \verb|\cormark[<num>]|
\item corresponding author text : \verb|\cortext[<num>]{<text>}|
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other marks}

At times, authors want footnotes which leave no marks in
the author names. The note text shall be listed as part of
the front matter notes. Class files provides
\verb|\nonumnote| for this purpose. The usage
\begin{lstlisting}
\nonumnote{<text>}
\end{lstlisting}
and should be entered anywhere before the \verb|\maketitle|
command for this to take effect. 

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX{} sectioning commands:
\verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection|,
\verb|\subsubsection|, and
\verb|\paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove
the numbering from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is not allowed.

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|ceurart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed \textit{above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \verb|table| to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption. The contents of the table itself must go in the
\verb|tabular| environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \verb|table*| to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\section{Math Equations}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \verb|math| environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\verb|\begin| \ldots \verb|\end| construction or with
the short form \verb|$| \ldots \verb|$|. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX};
this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0,
\end{math}
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}

A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \verb|equation|
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\verb|displaymath| environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX{}; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0.
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \verb|displaymath|
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  S_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} ,
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{x \to 0} (1 + x)^{1/x} = e
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader. Figure captions go below the figure. Your figures should
also include a description suitable for screen readers, to
assist the visually-challenged to better understand your work.

Figure captions are placed below the figure.


\section{Introduction}

CEUR-WS's article template provides a consistent \LaTeX{} style for
use across CEUR-WS publications, and incorporates accessibility and
metadata-extraction functionality. This document will explain the
major features of the document class.

If you are new to publishing with CEUR-WS, this document is a valuable
guide to the process of preparing your work for publication.

The ``\verb|ceurart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any CEUR-WS publication, and for any stage of publication, from
review to final ``camera-ready'' copy with {\itshape very} few changes
to the source.

This class depends on the following packages
for its proper functioning:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb|natbib.sty| for citation processing;
	\item \verb|geometry.sty| for margin settings;
	\item \verb|graphicx.sty| for graphics inclusion;
	\item \verb|hyperref.sty| optional package if hyperlinking is required in
	the document;
	\item \verb|fontawesome5.sty| optional package for bells and whistles.
\end{itemize}

All the above packages are part of any
standard \LaTeX{} installation.
Therefore, the users need not be
bothered about downloading any extra packages.



\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of Bib\TeX{} for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}|
command:
\begin{lstlisting}
\bibliography{bibfile}
\end{lstlisting}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the Bib\TeX{} file.


\subsection{Some examples}

A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an enumerated journal
article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire issue
\cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
\cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so series
should not be present since it has no vol. no.), a chapter in a
divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible book in a
series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book \cite{Knuth97},
an article in a proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for
example) (paginated proceedings article) \cite{Andler79}, a
proceedings article with all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an
example of an enumerated proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an
informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a doctoral dissertation
\cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online
document / world wide web resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07,
  Poker06}, a video game (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2)
\cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and (Case 3) a patent
\cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for publication \cite{rous08},
prolific author \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other
cites might contain `duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
\cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Multi-volume works as books
\cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A couple of citations with DOIs:
\cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, R, UMassCitations}.

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{acknowledgments}
  These are different acknowledgments.
\end{acknowledgments}
\end{lstlisting}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered
\verb|\section|; please use the ``\verb|acknowledgments|'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|\appendix|'' command:
\begin{lstlisting}
\appendix
\end{lstlisting}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. 

%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acknowledgments" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
