\section{Metrics}

\subsection{MIN}
For the open-ended task, \cite{VQA} uses following metrics
\[ \mbox{accuracy} = \min (\frac{\mbox{\# humans that provided that answer}}{3}, 1)\]
Thus if at least 3 workers provided the answer, then the answer is  100\% accurate.




\section{Baselines}

\subsection{per Q-type prior}
For the open-ended task, pick the most popular answer per question type. \cite{VQA}

\subsection{nearest neighbor}
Given a test image, question pair, first find the $ K $ nearest neighbor questions and associated images from the training set. Then, for the open-ended task, pick the most frequent ground truth answer from this set of nearest neighbor question, image pairs.
